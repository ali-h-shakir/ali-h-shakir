# Ali Shakir 

**Passionate about using data focused approaches to solve business problems**

I am an experienced data analytics professional with a strong passion for using data modeling approaches to generate insights that help support business stakeholders make forward looking decisions. As an accountant with a advisory/consulting background, who fell in love with analytics, my journey has allowed me develop a unique combination of data analysis and communication skills backed by strong financial understanding. In my career, I've contributed to multiple industries (Retail, Manufacturing & Consulting), and have experience working with multiple analytical tools (such as MS Excel, Alteryx, Knime & SQL). I've supplemented the use of these analytics by using data visualization tools (such as Power BI & Tableau) to help me communicate insights effectively, and have also made use of workflow optimization tools (such as MS Visio, Power Automate) to help me plan and automate tasks where possible.
