# Ali Shakir 

**Passionate about generating data driven insights to solve business problems**

I am an experienced data analytics professional, who is driven by curiosity, and has a passion for using analyzing data to learn insights and effectively present them so that they can help business stakeholders make forward looking informed decisions. As an accountant with an advisory/consulting background who fell in love with analytics, my journey has enabled me to develop a unique combination of data analysis and communication skills backed by strong financial understanding. In my career, I've contributed to multiple industries (Retail, Manufacturing, Public Sector, Risk Advisory & Management Consulting), and have experience working with different analytical tools (such as MS Excel, Alteryx, Knime & SQL). I've supplemented the use of these analytical tools by using data visualization software (such as Power BI & Tableau) to help communicate insights effectively, and have also used workflow optimization tools (such as MS Visio, Power Automate) to help plan and automate tasks where possible.

### SQL Projects

Files at the links below outline code for analysis I have conducted using SQL on certain datasets. 

1. [Analysis of Medical Doctors by Country and Year](https://github.com/ali-h-shakir/SQL_Projects/blob/main/Medical_Doctors_Data_Analysis.sql) : In this analysis, I have utilized mutliple SQL aspects such as Virtual Tables, Aggregation Functions, Windows Functions etc. to answer some interesting questions about the data such as top countries with number of doctors, percent of specialists vs GPs etc. The dataset 'doctors_data.csv' includes information about the total number of doctors, number of GPs, number of specialists and number of doctors per 10K population for multiple countries across a number of years.
