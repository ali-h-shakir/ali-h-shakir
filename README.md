# Ali Shakir 

**Passionate about generating data driven insights to solve business problems**

I am an experienced data analytics professional, who is driven by curiosity, and has a passion for using analyzing data to learn insights and effectively present them so that they can help business stakeholders make forward looking informed decisions. As an accountant with an advisory/consulting background who fell in love with analytics, my journey has enabled me to develop a unique combination of data analysis and communication skills backed by strong financial understanding. In my career, I've contributed to multiple industries (Retail, Manufacturing, Public Sector, Risk Advisory & Management Consulting), and have experience working with different analytical tools (such as MS Excel, Alteryx, Knime & SQL). I've supplemented the use of these analytical tools by using data visualization software (such as Power BI & Tableau) to help communicate insights effectively, and have also used workflow optimization tools (such as MS Visio, Power Automate) to help plan and automate tasks where possible.

### Below are some projects I've analyzed using SQL, along with visualizations in Power BI & Tableau


### SQL 

1. [Analysis of Medical Doctors by Country and Year](https://github.com/ali-h-shakir/SQL_Projects/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Medical%20Doctors/Medical_Doctors_Data_Analysis.sql) : In this analysis, I have utilized mutliple SQL aspects such as Virtual Tables, Aggregation Functions, Windows Functions etc. to answer some interesting questions about the data such as top countries with number of doctors, percent of specialists vs GPs etc. The dataset 'doctors_data.csv' includes information about the total number of doctors, number of GPs, number of specialists and number of doctors per 10K population for multiple countries across a number of years. 

### Power BI

1. [Analysis of Green Taxi Cabs in NY Boroughs](https://github.com/ali-h-shakir/PowerBI_Projects/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Green%20Taxi%20Cabs%20in%20NY%20Boroughs/Analysis%20of%20Green%20Taxi%20Cabs%20in%20NY%20Boroughs.pdf): This dashboard provides insights into multiple metrics associated with use of Green Taxi Cabs across NY Boroughs. Users can utilize filters to explore metrics such as Number of Rides picked up, Number of passengers, Avg Fare/Tip/Toll and payment preferences. Data Model illustrating relationships employed between dimension and fact tables is also included in the folder.

### R 

1. [Analysis of Bike-Share Company](https://github.com/ali-h-shakir/Projects/blob/main/Bike-Share%20Company/Analysis%20of%20Bike-Share%20Company.ipynb) : Completed this analysis in R as part of capstone project for Google Data Analytics Certificate. In this analysis, I have utilized R for data wrangling (renaming columns, converting column data types, consolidating data etc.), data cleaning (filtering out irrelevant data, parsing date-time etc.) data analyses (calculating ride length statistics, comparing ride-times by weekday, calculating average ride time, analyzing ridership) and creating visual graphics.
   
2. [Analysis of Group of Friends](https://github.com/ali-h-shakir/Projects/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Friends%20Group/Analysis%20of%20Group%20of%20Friends.ipynb) : This is a basic exploratory data analysis conducted a dataset about a group of friends. Includes calculation of basic summary statistics and some graphs.
